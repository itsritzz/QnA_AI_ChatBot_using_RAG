# Q&A AI ChatBot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain
![Demo Video](https://github.com/itsritzz/Langchain_RAG/blob/master/LangChian_gif/Lang_RAGbyRitz.gif)
## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using LangChain. The application leverages language models and retrievers to generate responses based on the conversation's context and additional external data retrieved from specified web links. Here is the architecture for the application:

## Features

- **Integrates Multiple Language Models and Embeddings:**
  - Uses the ChatGroq model and HuggingFaceEmbeddings for language processing and embedding generation.

- **History-Aware Retrievers for Context Understanding:**
  - Implements a history-aware retriever to consider previous interactions in the conversation for generating relevant responses.

- **Conversational Chain with Memory Capabilities:**
  - Utilizes a conversational chain that maintains session-specific chat history to provide contextually appropriate answers.

- **Web-Based User Interface with Streamlit:**
  - Provides an interactive web interface for users to input web links and interact with the assistant.

- **Customizable and Extendable:**
  - The application is designed to be flexible, allowing easy customization and extension for various use cases.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/Langchain_RAG.git
    cd Langchain_RAG
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    .\env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file and add the necessary API keys:

    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit Application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the Application:**

    - Open the provided local URL in your browser.
    - Input a website link in the sidebar to load content for the conversational chain.
    - Start chatting with the assistant and receive responses based on the loaded content.

## Functional Components

### Model and Embeddings Setup

- **Language Model:** Utilizes ChatGroq model for generating responses. [ChatGroq Documentation](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/groq/)
- **Embeddings:** Employs HuggingFaceEmbeddings for embedding generation.

### Session State Management

- **Initialization:** Ensures session-specific states are initialized for chat history, web links, user input, and message processing status.

### Conversational Chain Initialization

- **Document Loading and Splitting:** Loads documents from specified web paths and splits them into manageable chunks.
- **Vector Store and Retriever:** Creates a vector store from the documents and sets up a retriever for fetching relevant information.
- **History-Aware Retriever:** Uses a prompt template to rephrase user queries considering the conversation history.
- **Question Answering Chain:** Constructs a chain that uses the retriever and the language model to generate concise answers based on retrieved context.

### User Interface

- **Custom Styling:** Applies custom CSS to enhance the appearance of the Streamlit app.
- **Input Handling:** Captures user input and processes it to generate responses.
- **Chat History Display:** Displays the ongoing conversation, maintaining a clear interaction flow.

## Customization

- **Styling:** Customize the app's appearance by modifying the CSS in the Streamlit markdown section.
- **Model and Embeddings:** Switch to different language models or embeddings as required by updating the respective sections in the code.
